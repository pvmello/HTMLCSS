            <p> Status conditions (Japanese: 状態異常 abnormal condition), also referred to as status problems or status ailments, affect a Pokémon's ability to battle. There are three kinds of status. The first are non-volatile, the second are volatile, and the third lasts while a Pokémon is in battle. The Pokérus is a similar but unrelated concept.

              <ul class="all">
              <li><strong><p>Infatuation</p></strong>
            
  
  A Pokémon that is infatuated cannot attack 50% of the time, even against Pokémon other than the one it is infatuated with.</li>

              </p> 
  
              <li><strong><p>Poisoned</strong></p>
  
  A poisoned Pokémon loses a set amount of HP every turn. If the effect remains after the battle, the Pokémon will lose HP as the Trainer walks (1 HP of damage for every 4 steps), but after Pokémon Black and White there is no longer this effect. It can be cured with an Antidote, a PSNCureBerry, a Pecha Berry, or a Lum Berry. Poison and Steel type Pokémon cannot be poisoned, nor can Pokémon that have the ability Immunity or this behind a Substitute.</li>
            
  
              <li><strong><p>Paralyzed</p></strong>
  
  A paralyzed Pokémon has a 25% chance of not being able to attack every turn and their Speed is decreased by 50%. The status remains after battle like other major status ailments. Paralysis can be cured with a Paralyze Heal, a Cheri Berry, or a Lum Berry. Electric type Pokémon cannot be paralyzed, nor can Pokémon that have the ability Limber or those behind a Substitute.</li>
              
              <li><strong><p>Infatuation</p></strong>
  
  A Pokémon that is infatuated cannot attack 50% of the time, even against Pokémon other than the one it is infatuated with.</li>
             
  
              <li><strong><p>Burned</p></strong>
  
  Burned Pokémon lose 1/8 of their maximum HP at the end of each turn in addition having their Attack stat reduced by 50%. Burned Pokémon can be healed with Burn Heal, an Ice Berry, a Kuo Berry, or a Rawst Berry. Fire-type Pokémon cannot be burned, nor can Pokémon with the ability Water Veil or those behind a Substitute.</li>
             
  
              <li><strong><p>Frozen</p></strong>
  
  A frozen Pokémon cannot attack, but it can thaw out in a few turns. Fire type attacks can thaw out a frozen Pokémon more easily. Moves such as Flame Wheel, Flare Blitz and Sacred Fire can be used even if the user is frozen; these moves will thaw out the user. Ice-type Pokémon cannot be frozen, and neither can Pokémon with the ability Magma Armor. A frozen Pokémon can be healed with Ice Heal, a Burnt Berry, or an Aspear Berry.</li>
              
  
              <li><strong><p>Confused</p></strong>
  
  Once confused, a Pokémon will remain so for 1 to 4 turns, and during those turns have a 50% chance of damaging themselves and being unable to perform any other action for that turn. This status effect can be used even if the Pokémon is inflicted with another status condition, like Paralysis or Burn. Confusion can be healed by switching out the confused Pokémon. It can also be cured by using a Persim Berry, a Bitter Berry, a Full Heal, or the Yellow Flute. Pokémon with the ability Own Tempo cannot be confused.</li>
              
              <li><strong><p>Leech Seed</p></strong>
  
  The Pokémon loses 1/16th of his/her HP each turn, and the opponent gains what was lost, essentially having the same affect as a weaker, but continuous, Absorb. Some Grass type Pokémon cannot be re-seeded. Once Seeded, switching, fainting, using such moves as Rapid Spin will remove this.</li>

            <p><strong>Patterns</strong></p>
              
              <ul class="all">
                <li>Pokémon of a higher evolutionary stage will usually have higher base stats (both individually and in total) than their unevolved counterparts. The only exceptions to this pattern are Shedinja, whose base stat total is lower than Nincada's by 30 points, and Scizor and Kleavor, whose base stat totals are the same as Scyther's. Evolved Pokémon also often have similar distributions to their base stats as their unevolved relatives, such as Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam, who gain 15 points in each base stat upon evolving (except for Alakazam's Special Defense in Generation VI, which gains 25 points).</li>
  
  <li>Species from different branches of Pokémon with a split evolutionary line will often have similar base stats to each other, but in different distributions. For example, while Gardevoir's base stats for Attack and Special Attack are 65 and 125, respectively, its counterpart Gallade's Attack and Special Attack stats are reversed (125 and 65, respectively). Pokémon species that are exclusive to specific games but not explicitly related by evolution (such as Caterpie and Weedle) may also have base stats that are similar overall but have different distributions. Many alternate forms, particularly regional forms, likewise differ in distribution but not base stat total.</li>
  
  <li>Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion, except Mega Alakazam in Generation VI, result in a Pokémon's base stat total increasing by 100.</li>
  
  <li>Pokémon with very high base stat totals are often banned from battle facilities, since they are considered too powerful.</p>

        <p><strong>Individual strengths (Japanese: 生まれつきの強さ innate strengths)</strong></p> 
        
        <ul class="all"><li>Abbreviated IVs from its more commonly known fan term, individual values (Japanese: 個体値 individual values), are the Pokémon equivalent of genes. They are instrumental in determining the stats of a Pokémon, being responsible for the large variation in stats among untrained Pokémon of the same species. In the context of Generations I and II, which have a different IV system, IVs are also referred to as determinant values (DVs).
  
  Each of the six stats has an IV associated with it, with that IV coming into calculation alongside the Pokémon's base stats, Nature, and EVs to determine the actual stat number. A Pokémon's IVs are fixed when it is generated by the game (i.e. when it is encountered in the wild or given to the player by an NPC), and cannot be changed (although Hyper Training causes stats to become values corresponding the maximum IVs).
  
  In the games, the term potential is often used to allude to IVs, such as by the stats judge. Shigeru Ohmori has stated that the reason EVs and IVs are hidden is because he prefers to think of Pokémon as "real, living creatures".</li></ul>

          <p><strong>Types</strong></p>
            
           <ul class="all"><li> All Pokémon creatures and their moves are assigned certain types. Each type has several strengths and weaknesses in both attack and defense. In battle, you should use Pokémon and moves that have a type advantage over your opponent; doing so will cause much more damage than normal.
  
  A single-type advantage (for instance a Water attack against a Ground-type Pokémon) will net you double normal damage. The advantages also stack up, so a double-type advantage (for instance a Water attack against a Ground/Rock-type Pokémon) will net you quadruple damage. In both these cases you will see the message It's super effective! in-game after the attack.</li></u>
  
  <code>
                    let y = 13.
              </code>

                  This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.

          <header>Disadvantages</header>
  
          <p><strong>Types</strong></p>
  
          <ul class="all"><li>Conversely, a single- and double-type disadvantage will afflict half and a quarter normal damage respectively. Here you will see the message It's not very effective... in-game.
  
  Another advantage you can gain is Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB). As the name implies, this increases the power of the move if the attacking Pokémon has the same type as the move used (for example a Fire-type Pokémon using a Fire-type move). In this case the damage is 1.5 times normal. Again this is added to any other advantages, so a Water-type Pokémon using a Water-type move against a Ground/Rock-type Pokémon will bag you six times (2×2×1.5) normal damage!</ul></li>
